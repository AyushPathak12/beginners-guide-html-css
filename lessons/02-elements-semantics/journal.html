          <h3>Why Can&#8217;t I Catch this Bird?</h3>

          <p>I&#8217;ve struggled for so long to capture this one illusive species. It&#8217;s completely rare to find a road runner in the Utah desert, but here one exists. I want to capture it. I want to understand its origin, and its purpose.</p>

          <p>Maybe in discovering its ways, will I begin to understand my own.</p>

          <h3>Construction, Acme, Apex</h3>

          <p>Warner University preaches itself as the <i>&#8216;apex&#8217;</i> of education. Here I strive not just to satiate my understanding of birds, but to become one. I&#8217;ve found myself cross-dressing often in boa, plummage and more. What is it about their features that fascinates me so?</p>

          <p>The more birds I capture, the more I study them, the more I find myself becoming one&#8230;</p>

          <p>I&#8217;ve decided to pursue a bigger career in electrical drawings and schematics. All in my larger quest at understanding what it would take to become the ultimate of animals. </p>

          <h3>Bird Flu</h3>

          <p>Like Darwin I&#8217;ve became fascinated with birds. Their plumage. Their ability for flight. I was always curious how they related to their bigger, extinct brethren, the dinosaur.</p>

          <p>It&#8217;s fascinating to watch them flock. One of the only species to migrate, as an organic entity. I&#8217;m infatuated with them. And have chosen to purse my studies, and my career in understanding the the avian world.</p>
