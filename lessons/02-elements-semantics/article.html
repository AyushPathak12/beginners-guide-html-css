          <h3>Code</h3>
          <p>
            I can't believe how much I've learned in just one week at Starter League. In fact I've already created my first HTML page!

          <h3>People</h3>
          <p>
            Even better, I've met so many great people. My classmates are super motivated and we have the help and guidance of everyone on the Starter League team.

          <h3>The Future</h3>
          <p>
            I can't wait to see what else I learn and I'm looking forward to building something great (that helps me catch that pesky Road Runner)!
